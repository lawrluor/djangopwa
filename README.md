# Django PWA

The goal of this project is to provide a sample [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) to build [Progressive Web Applications (PWA)](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/). It is meant to serve as an example exhibiting what is possible and how.

Feel free to take inspiration from it!
